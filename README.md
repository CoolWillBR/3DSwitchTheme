This is a 3DS Menu Theme on Ulaunch made by XorTroll and thanks to him, I'm glad to have music on the Nintendo Switch because you know, you have to be honest, the menu of the normal switch is really dead, not dead I mean he don't have music but with Ulaunch its really great credits its for the XorTroll.
This one is from the menu:

And the second one is from when you press the Minus button for the homebrew apps:
![2024032512011200-2B962D4D8757B83A365B36F9DBA36413](https://github.com/CoolWillBR/3DSwitchTheme/assets/31536743/d7851038-61bf-42dc-8abb-130dbba676dd)
And the third one is when you press the zr or zl or R or L button for options menu:
![2024032512012000-2B962D4D8757B83A365B36F9DBA36413](https://github.com/CoolWillBR/3DSwitchTheme/assets/31536743/9da8689d-1614-4c68-93b8-fbdae977f916)
This took a while to upload because I'm busy man, sorry for the delay.
