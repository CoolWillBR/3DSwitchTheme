This is a 3DS Menu Theme on Ulaunch made by XorTroll and thanks to him, I'm glad to have music on the Nintendo Switch because you know, you have to be honest, the menu of the normal switch is really dead, not dead I mean he don't have music but with Ulaunch its really great credits its for the XorTroll.
